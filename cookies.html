        <h1 class="heading" id="c_definition">What are cookies?</h1>
        <p>
            Websites use HTTP cookies, or Internet/browser cookies, to track information about your time spent on a website and save it when you leave.
            Some uses of cookies are beneficial to the user’s experience, such as keeping you logged in or saving your shopping cart. The first example
            is of session management–your “session” being each time you visit a website–and the second, authentification; cookies are also used for
            personalization, like targeted advertising (Kaspersky). As you can imagine, when you visit a website, it first uses these cookies to identify
            you in order to, for example, ensure that it logs you into the correct account.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of HTTP cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted upon exiting a website while
            persistent cookies are saved forever or just for a certain period of time, able to be accessed over the course of multiple sessions
            (Kaspersky). Staying logged in is one use of a persistent cookie (Kaspersky); oftentimes, a user need only log in every week or so.
            Persistent cookies may also be used to track you, accumulating information from each of your sessions to build a profile, which may then
            be used to suggest certain products to you (Kaspersky). So far, what has been discussed is the activity of first-party cookies, the cookies
            created by the website you are using (Kaspersky). It is the third-party cookies that are more concerning and the ones you often reject
            or allow upon visiting a website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third-party cookies can be created by advertisers whose ads appear on the website you are currently viewing. These advertisers may also
            track your sessions on any website that contains their ads (Kaspersky). Another example is of social media companies: any time you see a
            button to share an article or webpage on Facebook, Facebook knows you have visited that site (Hoffman). Google announced in 2020 that it
            would get rid of third-party cookies by 2022; however, that move was delayed to 2023 and has since been delayed to 2024, so it’s hard to
            say when this ban will finally be implemented (Chavez qtd. In Morrison).
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading" id="consent">Cookie consent</h1>
        <p>
            On May 28, 2018, the EU put into effect the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requiring websites to receive user consent before
            they can use cookies (“What is GDPR?”). Although this law was passed in Europe, many websites handle the data of EU citizens, which means
            they are subject to this law as well (“What is GDPR?”). This is why you are now often met with a cookie pop-up banner upon entering a website.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, websites have taken it upon themselves to implement certain tricks in an effort to maximize the consent given. Some such
            tactics include forcing the user to deselect all uses of cookies they do not consent to, presenting the user with many options where the
            default is to “accept all,” highlighting or bolding the “accept all” button, or continually prompting users with the cookie banner each
            new session despite having already set their preferences (Machuletz and Böhme 481). There are likely many other tactics that are currently
            in use by various websites, designed to make the act of rejecting cookies as tedious as possible. <br>
            <button id="open_banner">Like this one</button>
            <div id="snackbar">Don't worry, this website doesn't actually collect cookies.</div>
        </p>
        <div id="cookie_banner" class="popup">
            <div class="popup-content">
                <h1>This website uses cookies.</h1>
                <p>By accepting cookies, you agree...</p>
                <button id="accept_cookies">Accept all cookies</button>
                <button id="reject_cookies">Reject all cookies</button>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            In fact, Facebook, Google, and Youtube made it so difficult to reject cookies that Facebook was fined 60 million euros, and Google 150
            million, for infringing the French Data Protection Act (CNIL). Due to the pervasiveness of these pop ups, users often become fatigued with
            selecting their desired settings and instead default to accepting all (Machuletz and Böhme 481). Furthermore, users who choose a default
            button to accept all cookies are less likely to remember their choice (Machuletz and Böhme 481), implying this decision is less of a
            conscious decision and more of an automated one, serving the primary purpose, for the user, of eliminating an obstacle to a website rather
            than consenting to being tracked.
        </p>
        <div class="ndiv">
            The “necessary cookies,” that one must accept do not carry any personal data and thus do not require consent (Machuletz and Böhme 481).
        </div>
        <h1 id="supercookies" class="heading">Supercookies</h1>
        <p>
            Supercookies aren’t technically cookies, but they are similar in their ability to gather information on users across multiple websites.
            They are harder to fend against and cannot simply be rejected on a website. Some supercookies, such as the evercookie, store their data
            in multiple locations, for example browsing history or HTML5 local storage (Hoffman). When a website notices you have deleted a supercookie
            from one location, the data for such supercookie is copied over from another, making them extremely resilient (Hoffman). This also means it
            is much more difficult for your browser or another piece of software, to block supercookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way a supercookie can identify you is through assigning a unique color to a few pixels when a new user visits a website, which are then
            stored in the user’s browser cache and loaded back onto the website to identify the user upon the start of a new session (Hoffman). Chrome,
            Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Tor have all taken steps to protect against supercookies; however, as the supercookies’ duplicitous tactics continue
            to evolve, these browsers may not be able to stop them all.
        </p>
        <h1 id="clearing" class="heading">Clearing cookies</h1>
        <p>
            In most browsers, you may use the Ctrl+Shift+Del or Command+Shift+Del shortcut to clear your cookies (Fisher). For more detailed instructions,
            check out <a href= "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981" target="_blank"

            Why delete cookies? Sometimes cookies may pick up information you would rather keep secret. Perhaps you have an addiction, medical illness,
            or other embarrassing secret that could be revealed from your browsing history. Would you want this information available to advertisers
            when they decide which ads may be most effective toward you? Your data can also be sold to airlines, hotel booking websites, and others to
            determine the highest price you would be willing to pay when entering their website.

            Fun fact: Google’s incognito browsing still allows third-party cookies but just deletes them from your browsing session. Although this may
            not seem concerning, did you know that there are other ways to track your browsing activity aside from cookies? Browser fingerprinting is
            one such way: it can uniquely identify your device and track it across the internet. Fingerprinting is NOT prevented by incognito/private
            browsing mode, meaning although cookies are deleted upon exiting your private browsing session, the advertisers behind the third-party
            cookies can still match that activity to your device through use of fingerprinting. In other words, your private browsing session isn’t
            as private as you think.
