        <p>
            A browser fingerprint is a form of online tracking. When using a website, scripts run in the background, providing a set of instructions
            to tell your browser what to do (Avast). These scripts have the ability to access enough information, without you knowing, about your browser
            settings, device specifications, and other information to uniquely identify you (Avast). Additionally, some information may be gathered
            passively from the HTTP header (Pugliese et al. 559)--HTTP headers contain metadata that is exchanged between your devices and the websites
            they access. This means that your unique profile, or “fingerprint,” can be used to track your activity across the Internet, even when using
            private or incognito browsing, making it more invasive than cookies (Avast).
        </p>
        <div class="ndiv">
            Examples of some information scripts can obtain: your browser and its settings, installed plugins, extensions, or other software, your
            timezone, your device’s language, font, or operating system, whether you have an adblocker installed
        </div>
        <p>
            In 2018, a study found 35.7% of computer fingerprints, and 18.5% of mobile device fingerprints, to be unique but also declared the state of
            a non-unique fingerprint to be fragile (Gómez-Boix et al. 312). It only takes a few minor changes in your browser settings or the download
            of a new plugin to individualize your fingerprint. A long-term study of fingerprinting was later performed in 2020 which found 64.6-94.5%
            of users trackable with their fingerprint remaining stable an average of 10.7-11.9 weeks (Pugliese et al. 572).

        <ul class="content-box">
            <li>
                <strong>Canvas fingerprinting:</strong> this forces your browser to draw a complex image that is not visible to the user, then performs
                an analysis on the result to identify information about your browser, operating system, graphics card, and more (Avast).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Javascript fingerprinting:</strong> this involves testing which fonts your browser is able to display, as opposed to using a
                “fallback font” when the desired one is unavailable (Gómez-Boix et al. 311).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Audio fingerprinting:</strong> this makes your browser play an audio sample and uses the outputted soundwaves to gather information
                about your device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Though you can delete your cookies, there is no way to delete your browser fingerprint, nor may they be stopped by VPNs (Avast). The scripts
            that collect your information are also vital for your browser to run the website, without them the website would break (Avast). Fingerprints
            can be used to track your activity and link it to you despite all other protections you may take. Check how well your computer set-up defends
            against fingerprinting <a href="https://browserleaks.com/canvas" target="_blank" title="https://browserleaks.com/canvas">here</a> (unique = bad).

        <h1 class="heading" id="protection">Preventing fingerprinting</h1>
        <p>
            As browser fingerprinting is entirely legal, it is up to you to prevent it on your device. Although VPNs, ad blockers, and private browsing
            cannot stop fingerprinting, there are other tools you can use to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some browsers contain anti-fingerprinting protection, such as Brave, Firefox, or Epic. Some browsers, like Firefox, will require tweaking
            some settings to utilize their online tracking and data collection prevention. These will likely offer the best free protection against
            fingerprinting that exists right now. Alternatively, you can download other software specially designed for keeping you safe from
            fingerprinting, such as Avast AntiTrack ($49.99/year).
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, some believe fingerprinting will become less dangerous as the Internet evolves–e.g. the departure from plugins such as the
            once ubiquitous Flash–with one study estimating the removal of HTTP headers and browser plugins to decrease the occurrence of unique
            fingerprints by 36% (Laperdrix et al.).
