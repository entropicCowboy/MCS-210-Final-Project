        <p>
            Trackers can obtain private and sensitive information about you, which can then be combined to create a profile and sold to data brokers.
            Even seemingly harmless or irrelevant information, such as your purchasing history, can be used to make powerful assumptions about you.
            After receiving your data, data brokers can sell it to advertisers, so they may deliver personalized ads to you, insurance providers, giving
            them information which could be used to raise your rates, or to ecommerce sites, finding the largest price you would likely pay for a good
            or service (Avast).
        </p>
        <p>
            Credit bureaus, a financial form of data brokerage, collect and sell credit history data that plays a significant role in mediating access
            to finance (Rieke et al. V). However, due to insufficient credit information for credit bureaus to create a report, “almost 20% of Americans
            face challenges in accessing mainstream credit,” a disproportionate amount of which are Blacks, Hispanics, and lower-income consumers
            (Rieke et al. 32).
        </p>
        <p>
            Police in both the United States and Europe purchase personal data from data brokers in order to profile citizens, political parties use
            the data to target their most receptive audience, and US employers routinely purchase error-prone criminal history reports for job
            applicants (Rieke et al. V).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the brokerage data available to the police comes from social media. While this data is publicly available to the police, these
            tools make it easier for police to surveil citizens, at times supplying weak evidence for an arrest. For example, the NYPD have “used
            potentially innocent actions such as “liking” a photograph on Facebook as the basis for arrest” (Rieke et al. 36).

        <p>
            A large amount of consumer data within the US goes unregulated due to poor legal protection; in the EU, although safeguards exist to
            protect personal data, including from data brokers and law enforcement, the abstractness of such rules leave them difficult to apply
            in practical situations (Rieke et al. VI).
