        <h3 id="data_brokers" class="heading">Data brokers</h1>
        <p>
            Trackers can obtain private and sensitive information about you, which can then be combined to create a profile and sold to data brokers.
            Even seemingly harmless or irrelevant information, such as your purchasing history, can be used to make powerful assumptions about you.
            After receiving your data, data brokers can sell it to advertisers, so they may deliver personalized ads to you, insurance providers, giving
            them information which could be used to raise your rates, or to ecommerce sites, finding the largest price you would likely pay for a good
            or service (Avast).
        </p>
        <p>
            Credit bureaus, a financial form of data brokerage, collect and sell credit history data that plays a significant role in mediating access
            to finance (Rieke et al. V). However, due to insufficient credit information for credit bureaus to create a report, “almost 20% of Americans
            face challenges in accessing mainstream credit,” a disproportionate amount of which are Blacks, Hispanics, and lower-income consumers
            (Rieke et al. 32).
        </p>
        <p>
            Police in both the United States and Europe purchase personal data from data brokers in order to profile citizens, political parties use
            the data to target their most receptive audience, and US employers routinely purchase error-prone criminal history reports for job
            applicants (Rieke et al. V).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the brokerage data available to the police comes from social media. While this data is publicly available to the police, these
            tools make it easier for police to surveil citizens, at times supplying weak evidence for an arrest. For example, the NYPD have “used
            potentially innocent actions such as “liking” a photograph on Facebook as the basis for arrest” (Rieke et al. 36).
        </p>
        <h3 id="legality" class="heading">Legality</h1>
        <p>
            A large amount of consumer data within the US goes unregulated due to poor legal protection; in the EU, although safeguards exist to
            protect personal data, including from data brokers and law enforcement, the abstractness of such rules leave them difficult to apply
            in practical situations (Rieke et al. VI).

            Installing a new browser is a pretty simple process. You can usually easily find the download button on the browser's website, then, after the
            file has been downloaded, click it to initiate the installation process (don't worry about allowing the program to make changes to your device).
            The program will do all the work for you, and, upon opening the browser after it's installed, will usually prompt you for the option to make it
            your default browser--otherwise, a simple Google search should provide you with the steps to find how to do so in your device's settings.

            11 most secure browsers for private browsing in 2023 - PrivacySavvy</a>
        </p>
        <h3 id="private" class="heading">Private browsing</h3>
        <p>
            What does private browsing really mean? Its initially intended use was to provide better privacy for those using a shared computer by not
            saving search/browsing history and erasing cookies from each session. Your activity may still be seen by your Internet service provider,
            school/employer, the website itself, and sometimes even third parties.

            Check out this cheeky warning for incognito browsing from an old version of Chrome: <br><br>
            <img src="old_incognito.png" alt="old Google Chrome Incognito notice" width="85%"> <br><br>
            Strangely enough, Google removed the comment about secret agents in their updated warning:<br><br>
            <img src="incognito.png" alt="current Google Chrome Incognito notice" width="85%">
        </p>
        <h3 id="vpn" class="heading">VPNs</h3>
        <p>
            Although VPNs are typically powerless against browser fingerprinting–unless they explicitly offer protection against that as well–they
            may still defend against cookies. When navigating a website, your internet service provider (ISP) assigns you a unique IP address, which
            may then be used to identify you by cookies and your ISP. VPNs make use of remote servers to create a “tunnel” for your internet traffic,
            making it so the websites you view are hidden from your ISP, and your IP address is hidden by the websites you visit–they instead see the
            IP address of your VPN server (ExpressVPN). So although your sessions may still be tracked, they cannot be linked to you, making your
            Internet browsing experience more anonymous.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Here are some well-rated VPNs that each have the standard VPN features:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
                <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a> (Free, ~$5.50/month, ~$8.75/month):
                the free version has no limit on data usage, but you can only access servers in the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://nordvpn.com/pricing" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> ($3.99/month, $5.19/month, $6.69/month)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://order.surfshark.com/?pricing" target="_blank">Surfshark</a>
                 ($2.30/month, $3.99/month, $12.95/month): Surfshark doesn’t have as many features as ProtonVPN or NordVPN, but it doesn’t place a
                 limit on the number of devices you can put on one subscription, and it provides a pretty good low-cost option.

                trackers
            </li>

            Search Engine: DuckDuckGo is widely considered to be the best alternative to Google for a search engine that values user privacy.
            DuckDuckGo famously advertises a zero-tracking policy and automatically routes you to the encrypted version of a website when possible.
            While it did recently come under fire for a discovered contractual obligation to allow some Microsoft trackers, the company is working
            on lessening the data Microsoft can collect and is still by far more private than Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may set DuckDuckGo as your default search engine by searching for the option in your browser’s settings or by
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" target="_blank">downloading the browser extension</a>
            (supported for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, Edge, and Opera). DuckDuckGo also offers a mobile browser for Apple and Android devices.

            There are many different options available for those looking to protect their privacy online, and most of them, including installing a new
            browser, are relatively easy and quick. However, you should never expect to maintain complete privacy on the Internet because there's always
            a chance that despite the security measures you take, you will still be identified, perhaps by fingerprinting or perhaps another new method
            of online tracking. Or, maybe this really all was for nothing, and you'll just get hacked.
